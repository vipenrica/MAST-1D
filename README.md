# MAST-1D - Sand & Mud - Minnesota River
Morphodynamics and Sediment Tracers in 1-D (MAST 1-D) - Minnesota River Version

This repository is a work in progress. It contains source codes and published papers with the description of models of river morphodynamics with an off-channel sediment reservoir representing an alluvial floodplain. The mathematical formulation was first implemented by Lauer and Parker (2008a, b, c) and subsequently modified by Viparelli et al., (2013), Lauer et al., (2016), DeRego et al. (2020), Viparelli and Eke (2021). 

There are two main versions of MAST-1D, one for sand bed rivers (Lauer and Parker, 2008a,b; Viparelli et al., 2013, Viparelli and Eke, 2021) and the other for gravel bed rivers (Lauer et al., 2016, DeRego et al., 2020). 

Models are either VBA macros embedded in excel workbooks or python scripts. Programming in VBA was convenient when models were first developed and tested because it allowed the collaboration with resarchers who did not have programming expertise. 

This repository contains excel files with embedded VBA macros used for the Minnesota River application of the MAST-1D version for sand bed rivers. 
The repository with files related to the analytical solution to predict the equlibrium channel geometry is https://github.com/vipenrica/Channel-geometry
The repository of the gravel bed river version, which is written in python and is maintained by Wes Lauer, is https://github.com/MAST-1D/MAST-1D-2.0. 

Excel files with different sub-models to compute channel migration are uploaded in this repository. Equilibrium files contain the Viparelli and Eke (2021) analytical model with various sub-models to compute annual migration rate and point bar height. Transient files contain version of the full model differing for the approach to compute annual migration rate and point bar height. File extension 'sf' indicate that bank migrations are computed with the Ege et al. (2014) model so that channel width and point bar height are both allowed to change in space and time. File extension 'eng' indicates that channel banks are not allowed to migrate independently; centerline migration rate and point bar height are computed as in Ikeda et al. (1981). File extension 'fix' indicates the mean annual channel migration rate and point bar height are specified values that do not vary in space and time, as in Viparelli et al. (2013).
