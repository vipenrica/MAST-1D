# MAST-1D - Sand & Mud - Minnesota River
Morphodynamics and Sediment Tracers in 1-D (MAST 1-D) - Application to the Minnesota River

This repository is a work in progress. It contains source codes and published papers with the description of models of river morphodynamics with an off-channel sediment reservoir representing an alluvial floodplain. The mathematical formulation was first implemented by Lauer and Parker (2008a, b, c) and subsequently modified by Viparelli et al., (2013), Lauer et al., (2016), DeRego et al. (2020), Viparelli and Eke (2021). 
There are two main versions of MAST-1D, one for sand bed rivers (Lauer and Parker, 2008a,b; Viparelli et al., 2013, Viparelli and Eke, 2021) and the other for gravel bed rivers (Lauer et al., 2016, DeRego et al., 2020). Models are either VBA macros embedded in excel workbooks or python scripts. Programming in VBA was convenient when models were first developed and tested because it allowed the collaboration with resarchers who did not have programming expertise. 


This repository is organized as follows: different versions of the model are stored and made public in different folders/directories. We plan to periodically update this repository wiht the latest versions of MAST-1D.
